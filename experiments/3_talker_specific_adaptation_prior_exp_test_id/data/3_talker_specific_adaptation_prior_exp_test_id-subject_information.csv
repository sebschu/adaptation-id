1558,cond6,37,Yes,"I felt it was an interesting experiment. I think the experiment was to see if people picked up on how each person (the man and the woman) interpreted/used the words ""might"" and ""probably."" I know if tripped me up a couple of times when choosing which gumball machine I saw in the previous scenario.

As for what could be improved, I think the text box above where I was asked if I noticed any difference between the two speakers could be made bigger so that it is easier to see what you are typing.  ",0,2,Female,English,"I think the woman was more likely to use the word ""probably"" if the color of the desired gumball was the majority, even if just by a few, whereas the man used the term ""might."" I think he only said probably if the amount of desired colored gumballs were much greater than the undesired ones.",,,1

1522,cond6,35,Yes,,4,1,Male,English,"It seems like the man was more literal (Only saying ""probably"" when it was more likely, and ""might"" when it was less likely.)  There were a few instances its seems the woman said ""might"" when it was the more likely scenario.",,,1

1566,cond6,23,Yes,It was repetitive some but I wouldn't say it was boring and it was always clear what to do. The only thing is the number sliders were tricky! It would decrease or increase whatever number I put it at and I like using whole numbers!,0,1,Female,English,"The male speaker was more positive in his statements.

1548,cond0,29,Yes,I think it was just determining what I would imagine each person would say and how I would measure their probability to estimate.,4,1,Male,English,"Yes, the male seemed to say ""probably"" when it was closer to half and half.

1563,cond4,50,Yes,It was interesting.

1513,cond3,49,Yes,I think the attention checks should be moved to a different place or changed. They were very distracting.
